## Introduction

Seeking more meaningful ways to assess success in journalism has led us to explore different metrics and approaches to understanding how people come to care about stories they encounter. This document captures what these metrics are, why we chose them, and how we are using them.

## Measures and Indicators

First, let's be clear about what we mean by metrics. Metrics are a catch-all term used to represent the different methods we employ to understand change over time across a number of dimensions. They are made up of explicit measures and can be combined to produce indicators, which hint us to specific outcomes and trends.

### Measures
A **measure** is a number or a quantity that records a directly observable value or performance. All measures are composed of a value (a number) and a unit of measure. The number provides magnitude for the measure (how much), while the unit gives number a meaning (what is measured).

Examples:

```
1,234,567 Pageviews
8,901,234 Sessions
567,890 Facebook Likes

```

**Tip:** Not all systems used to track measures have the same definition for units with the same name, so be sure to check the system's definition of the unit before comparing the same measure across different tracking mechanisms.

Examples:

```
Pageview: An instance of a user visiting a particular page on a website.

Sessions: A group of interactions that take place on a site within a given time frame. In Google Analytics, a sessions is set to 30 minutes by default, but this can be changed)

Facebook Likes: Number of times the Like link was cliked on in a Facebook post

```

All measures are counts of a particular unit over a period of time. For a measure to be meaningful, it should always be contextualized with the period of time that it relates to. 


### Indicators
An **indicator** is a qualitative or quantitative factor or variable that provides a simple and reliable means to measure achievement, to assess the performance of the entity taking action or changes resulting from a specific intervention. It aggregates or combines multiple measures in an explicit formula.

Examples:

```
33% Bounce Rate (In Google Analytics, the percentage of single-page sessions)

75% Completion Rate (Defined differently based on the presentation of story - in a video or audio piece it is the aggregation of total time played over video duration whereas for an interactive graphic it could be time spent viewing the graphic relative to an arbitrary ideal period of time)


```

## Linger Rate
Number of seconds a graphic (chart/data table) is displayed in the user's viewport.


## Shares Per 1000 Users
Number of Facebook shares per 1000 (GA) user sessions.
