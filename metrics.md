## Introduction

Seeking more meaningful ways to assess success in journalism has led us to explore different metrics and approaches to understanding how people come to care about stories they encounter. This document captures what these metrics are, why we chose them, and how we are using them.

## Measures and Indicators

First, let's be clear about what we mean by metrics. Metrics are a catch-all term used to represent the different methods we employ to understand change over time across a number of dimensions. They are made up of explicit measures and can be combined to produce indicators, which hint us to specific outcomes and trends.

### Measures
A **measure** is a number or a quantity that records a directly observable value or performance. All measures are composed of a value (a number) and a unit of measure. The number provides magnitude for the measure (how much), while the unit gives number a meaning (what is measured).
